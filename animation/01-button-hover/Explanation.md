So from the original button, I tried to modify it to be more like the subscribe button from youtube, and then change it up a little, adding borders and making the button bigger. 

```
#subscribe-container {
  width: 110vw;
  height: 110vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

button {
  border-radius: 220px;
  border: 5px solid black;
  background-color: #e71212;
  color: white;
  font-size: 20px;
  padding: 22px 24px;
  text-align: center;
}
```
Certainly! Here's the explanation with the pronoun "I":

```css
#subscribe-container {
  width: 110vw;
  height: 110vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

1. `width: 110vw;`: I increased the width of the container to 110% of the viewport width (`vw` unit). This means the container will be 10% wider than the viewport.

2. `height: 110vh;`: I increased the height of the container to 110% of the viewport height (`vh` unit). This means the container will be 10% taller than the viewport.

3. `display: flex;`: I used the "flex" value for the `display` property, which enables flexbox layout for its children.

4. `flex-direction: column;`: I set the direction of the flex container's main axis to be vertical (top to bottom). The children will be arranged vertically inside the container.

5. `justify-content: center;`: I aligned the flex container's children along the main axis (vertically, in this case) to the center of the container.

6. `align-items: center;`: I aligned the flex container's children along the cross axis (horizontally, in this case) to the center of the container.

7. `font-family: Arial, sans-serif;`: I specified the font-family, instructing the browser to use Arial font if available, and if not, fallback to a generic sans-serif font.

Next, the CSS for the button:

```css
button {
  border-radius: 220px;
  border: 5px solid black;
  background-color: #e71212;
  color: white;
  font-size: 20px;
  padding: 22px 24px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

1. `border-radius: 220px;`: I increased the border radius of the button to 220 pixels. This makes the button's corners more rounded, creating a circular appearance.

2. `border: 5px solid black;`: I used a "5px solid black" border style for the button. It gives the button a 5-pixel-wide solid black border.

3. `background-color: #e71212;`: I set the background color of the button to a shade of red (#e71212).

4. `color: white;`: I set the text color of the button to white. This ensures the text color contrasts well with the red background.

5. `font-size: 20px;`: I set the font size of the button text to 20 pixels.

6. `padding: 22px 24px;`: I added padding to the button, providing space between the button's content and its edges. The top and bottom padding are 22 pixels, while the left and right padding are 24 pixels.

7. `text-align: center;`: I centered the button text horizontally within the button's width.

In summary, the changes I made result in a container that is 10% wider and taller than the viewport, containing a circular button with a solid black border and a red background. The button text is centered both horizontally and vertically inside the button. The overall appearance has a bold and eye-catching style, which might be suitable for specific design choices.
